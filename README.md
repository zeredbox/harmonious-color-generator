When you choose colours in a completely random way, the result is not always harmonious. The HSB mode rather than RGB for the choice of colours allows, from one colour, to easily find colours that go well together.

The project allows you to : 
- choose a base colour (manually or randomly)
- display the colours that match the base colour in different modes (harmonic,)
- by moving the mouse over the chosen colours, you can see their values in RGB and HSB.
